            <h2>narrative</h2>
            <p>I am building projects that reimagine how we approach time and tasks. I grew up in the Leawood and Olathe suburbs of Kansas City and moved to the KC metro area in my early twenties to find community. That search led me to KC Women in Tech, which grounded me and underscored the importance of representation. However, my confidence in coding remained a journey I had to continue on my own. At the end of 2019, I took over the Intersectionality Meetup—just before the pandemic shifted our world online. My focus became fostering a community that could endure such a global event. During this time, I also joined KC Tenants, motivated by the belief that securing housing is fundamental, no matter the circumstances. This experience galvanized my understanding that collective organizing is essential for building a better future. My desire to work in development persisted. I found a position as a Business Administrator at a WordPress company, where I continued learning and striving to embody the kind of programming ethos I wanted to see in the world. I later graduated from LaunchCode, though building my technical confidence remained an ongoing process. My commitment to organizing deepened. I became a founding member of the childcare team and an early member of the orientation team for KC Tenants. I also worked as a coding instructor for children and served as a field manager for a city council campaign. In my current iteration, I have come to accept that I will often be afraid, and that my affinity for organizing is stronger than my affinity for pure development. I understand that my affinity for anything is built within the community I'm part of. I am afraid, and I am ready—ready to meet people who want to reimagine the world through the lens of liberation for all, using whatever tools we can find together.</p>

            <h2>stake</h2>
            <p>my stake is in the labor of care i provide outside of my professional life. the labor that makes life possible. the labor that makes life worth living. the labor that builds community. the labor that ensures survival. the labor that creates joy. the labor that builds connection. the labor that builds trust. the labor that builds love. the labor that builds us.</p>
