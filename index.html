                    <h2> Welcome!</h2>
                      <p>I’m a developer in training, passionate about improving old systems with new technology! Once I’ve completed the UCM course I will be pursuing my interest in combining politics and technology. </p>
                      <p>One project I am already working on is voter registration for high school students. I recently learned that many high schools in the KC metropolitan area provide those turning 18 with little to no assistance as they register to vote.</p>
                      <p>I intend to create the organizational software myself and others need to register those students.</p>

                    <h2> Where I’m From</h2>
                      <p>Born and raised in Kansas City, makes it more than just a place, it’s home. I enjoy cooking, traveling, and sunshine. My favorite BBQ joint in Kansas City is Joe’s KC.</p>
                      <p>I am the eldest of four siblings by ten years. Being the oldest pushes me to work harder and achieve more.</p>
                      <p>I plan on continuing my Bachelors in Political Science so I can better understand the system I am trying to change.</p>

                         <p>I enjoy driving, road-tripping, and maybe speeding a little too much. Before my 20s are over, I hope to road trip across the United States.</p>
                        <h3>What is your dream job?</h3>
                          <p>To be in a position where my help has a long term impact.</p>
